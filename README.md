# MetaBlog -  Blog App

## üåê Demo

Here is a working live demo: https://metablog.molaraiche.com/

## üìù Description

Welcome to MetaBlog! Here, I'll share what inspired me to create it, the problems it aims to solve, and the insights I've gained throughout the process. Note that this project is currently in its MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage and will continue to evolve.

- Motivation:
  I was motivated to build MetaBlog as a way to explore and showcase my skills in web development, specifically using the latest version of Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I wanted to create a platform that provides an efficient way to share ideas and knowledge while also highlighting my ability to build clean, scalable, and responsive web applications.

- Features and Plans:
  I plan to use Next.js as a full-stack framework for this project, incorporating authentication for admins, authors, and readers. Readers and authors will be able to comment on posts, enhancing interaction and engagement within the platform.

- Search and Filter:
  The platform includes search and filter functionality, making it easier for users to find specific content quickly.

- What I Learned:
  During the development process, I gained experience with key features of Next.js, including server-side rendering, dynamic routes, and the benefits of its new version. I also enhanced my TypeScript skills, which helped me ensure type safety and better code maintainability. Using Tailwind CSS allowed me to rapidly prototype and create a responsive, visually appealing design. I learned how to integrate multiple components and manage state effectively, making the application not only visually impressive but also easy to use and navigate.
